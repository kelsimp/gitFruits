A story
“In 1607, a gentleman named Redeshawe in Halifax, West Yorkshire inherited £10 from his aunt. He used the money to buy a Turkish carpet, which he then brought home and spread over the stone flags of his parlor. He then drank some beer and fell asleep in a chair by the fire. He awoke at two in the morning to find the carpet covered with three or four hundred people, each about two or three inches high. Mr. Redeshawe observed that the most important individuals among them, both men and women, were gorgeously attired and gold and silver armor and that they rode white rabbits which were to them as elephants are to us. When he asked what they were doing, one brave soul among them climbed up to his shoulder and bellowed in his ear that they intended to fight a battle according to the rules of Honoré Bonet and Mr Redeshawes carpet was exactly suited to their purpose because the regularity of the pattern helped the heralds determine that each army was positioned correctly and took no unfair advantage over the other. However Mr. Redeshawe did not choose that battle should be fought upon his new carpet and took a broom from the closet - but then died of boredom.”
